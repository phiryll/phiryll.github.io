# Lexicographic Byte Order Encoding

Techniques for encoding basic data types, arbitrary precision integral
and floating point types, ISO 8601 date-time instants, and aggregates
(structures or lists) of those types in a way that preserves their
natural ordering when sorted in lexicographic byte order. Also, a
technique for encoding
[WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text) as byte strings
in a way allowing geospatial searches to be implemented as byte string
prefix searches.
