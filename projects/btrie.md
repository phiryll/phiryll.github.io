# Persistent Byte Trie

Byte tries are not a new thing, but persistent ones might be (in the
sense of a [Persistent Data
Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure)).
It would make an excellent in-memory index for [lexicographically
byte-ordered data](lexicographic.md), and would also provide a
mechanism for [data history tracking](data-history.md). And also, this
would actually be a fairly fun thing to code, at least for me.
