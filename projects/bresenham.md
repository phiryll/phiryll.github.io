# A Recursive Variant of Bresenham's Line Algorithm

Bresenham's line algorithm is a well-known algorithm for painting
unaliased lines on a computer screen using only integer arithmetic.
Bresenham's run-slice algorithm is an improvement of the original
algorithm. The principles behind the run-slice algorithm can be
extended to a recursive algorithm. This reformulation makes apparent
the relationship between Bresenham's line algorithm and Euclid's
algorithm (for computing the greatest common divisor), for which
successive Fibonacci numbers are the worst case input. The algorithm
(any variant) can also be shown to solve a more general problem of
evenly distributing items among a sequence of bins, and can be applied
to (among other things) image scaling.
