# A Place To Put My Stuff

## Projects

These are not projects which already have repositories, which can be
found at [my github profile page](https://github.com/phiryll). Some of
these are in the formative stages, while others are things that I've
actually done at least once. They all need their own distinct
repositories once details start to get fleshed out (project names, in
particular).
