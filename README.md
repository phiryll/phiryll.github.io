# A Place To Put My Stuff

## Projects

These are not projects with repositories, which can be found on my
[profile page](https://github.com/phiryll) and
[gists](https://gist.github.com/phiryll). Some of these are in the
formative stages, while others I've actually done at least once. They
all need their own repositories once details get fleshed out (project
names, in particular).
