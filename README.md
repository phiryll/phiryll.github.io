# A Place To Put My Stuff

## Projects

These are not projects with repositories, which can be found on my
[profile page](https://github.com/phiryll) and
[gists](https://gist.github.com/phiryll). Some of these are in the
formative stages, while others I've actually done at least once. They
all need their own repositories once details get fleshed out. These
are in the order that I think I want to tackle them.

* [Collision Calculator](projects/collision-calculator.md)
* [Recursive Bresenham's Line Algorithm](projects/bresenham.md)
* [Revision Control for Data](projects/data-history.md)  
  Putting this off just because it's such a large project.
* [WKT Encoding](projects/wkt.md)
* [Painting Windows Front-to-Back](projects/window-painting.md)
* [Mutation Tracker](projects/mutation-tracker.md)

## Other Things

* [My Rules of Thumb](docs/rules-of-thumb.md)
* [Notes on Concurrency and Distributed Systems](docs/concurrency.md)
