# A Place To Put My Stuff

## Projects

These are not projects which already have repositories, which can be
found on my [profile page](https://github.com/phiryll) and
[gists](https://gist.github.com/phiryll). Some of these are in the
formative stages, while others are things that I've actually done at
least once. They all need their own distinct repositories once details
start to get fleshed out (project names, in particular).

* [Revision Control for Data](projects/data-history.md)
* [Lexicographic Byte Order Encoding](projects/lexicographic.md)
* [Persistent Byte Trie](projects/btrie.md)
* [Recursive Bresenham's Line Algorithm](projects/bresenham.md)
* [Painting Windows Front-to-Back](projects/window-painting.md)

## Other Things

* [My Rules of Thumb](docs/rules-of-thumb.md)
* [Notes on Concurrency and Distributed Systems](docs/concurrency.md)

## Ancient Projects

These are old, **very** old. Be gentle in your criticism. There may be
a few bits that can be resurrected, but most of this should remain in
the dustbin of history.
