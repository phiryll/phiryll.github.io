# Do Telescopes Need Lenses and Mirrors?

Let me preface this with the fact that I don't know enough about
optics to determine whether this idea would actually work.

I understand why you need a lens or mirror to focus incoming light
down to the size of your sensor (eye, photographic plate, CCD, etc.).
What I don't understand is why your sensor needs to be small. Can't
the primary mirror in a telescope be replaced with a large array of
CCDs? Software which currently perturbs mirrors for adaptive optics
could instead operate directly on the raw data, correcting without
mechanics. An array of CCDs should be cheaper than a large mirror as
well.
